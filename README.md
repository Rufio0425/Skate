# Skate After School
This was a project I worked on for a local client Non-Profit group that I actively serve with. The page is used to register new volunteers and offer information about the organization.

# Motivation
At RockIT bootcamp we were taught the LAMP stack and this project helped solidify my knowledge of what full stack development looks like! The project also taught me how I can give back to a cause that I love while learning at the same time.
